    "description": "[IATA Open API Working Group](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/workgroups/passenger-standards-conference/architecture-technology-strategy/#tab-2) aims to facilitate the creation of airline industry API standards and best practices based on open technology, open industry-owned data definitions. \n \n# API Standards \nThe group has developed the first industry adopted REST API Standards: [Open Air API standards and best practices](https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AIDM/pages/588873733/IATA+Open+Air+API+Best+Practices+Standards). \n\n# API Certification\nIATA Open Air certification process validates the compliance of APIs against the best practices. \n\n# Open Air JSON schema library\nThe Open Air JSON schema library is officially released and available to be consumed by any relevant industry parties in the API design. \n\nWe invite you to share your feedback on the schema library with openair@iata.org.\n\n## Objective\nAs part of best practices, data definition of the standard proprietary APIs are derived from the standard data model, to ensure consistency of definition with the other APIs. Open Air JSON schema library has been designed by the Open API group, as the source of standard data definition in JSON schema format.\n\nFor the consistency of data definition in the industry proprietary APIs, the IATA Open API working group has designed the procedure and specification to derive the JSON schema library from AIDM integrated model under the governance view, including all standard data entities and their definition. \n\n## AIDM\nIATA maintains the [Airline Industry standard Data Model (AIDM)](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/workgroups/passenger-standards-conference/architecture-technology-strategy/industry-data-model/), under the governance of [Change Management Group](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/workgroups/passenger-standards-conference/architecture-technology-strategy/#tab-1).\nThis Open Air JSON schema library represents the standard data model under the governance view of AIDM. \n\n## Consumption Guide\n\nDevelopers should read the [JSON schema library consumption guide](https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AIDM/pages/588873747/IATA+Open+Air+JSON+Library+Consumption+Guide) to understand how to use the standard schema objects in the proprietary API design and achieve the IATA Open Air certification.
